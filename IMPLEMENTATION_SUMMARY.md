# Credit History Generator - Implementation Summary

## Overview
Successfully implemented a comprehensive Credit History Generator for synthetic customer data generation as part of the larger credit risk modeling pipeline.

## Files Created

### 1. `credit_history_generator.py` (725 lines)
Main implementation file containing:

#### Core Classes
- **`RiskConfig`**: Configurable parameters for risk distributions and correlations
- **`CreditHistoryGenerator`**: Main class with all credit history generation methods

#### Key Methods Implemented
✅ **Payment History Scoring** (300-850 scale)
- Realistic normal distribution with demographic correlations
- Income, age, and employment stability adjustments
- Proper range validation (300-850)

✅ **Credit Utilization Generation** (0-95%)
- Beta distribution base with income/debt correlations
- Lower income → higher utilization logic
- Business rule enforcement (max 95%)

✅ **Credit History Length Generation**
- Age-based constraints (cannot exceed age - 18)
- Gamma distribution for realistic patterns  
- Special handling for young customers (higher probability of no history)

✅ **Number of Accounts Generation** (0-20)
- Poisson distribution with income-based adjustments
- Credit history length correlations
- Zero accounts for customers with no credit history

✅ **Recent Credit Inquiries** (0-10)
- Correlated with utilization and payment scores
- Higher utilization → more inquiries (credit seeking behavior)

✅ **Debt-to-Income Ratio Generation** (0-95%)
- Age and employment stability correlations  
- Credit utilization impact
- Industry standard compliance (most customers < 60% DTI)

✅ **Composite Risk Scoring** (0-100)
- Weighted combination of all risk factors:
  - Payment history (35%)
  - Credit utilization (25%) 
  - DTI ratio (20%)
  - Credit history length (15%)
  - Recent inquiries (5%)

✅ **Default Probability Calculation**
- Based on composite risk score
- Payment history adjustments
- DTI impact modeling
- Realistic base rate (5%) with risk multipliers

✅ **Business Rule Validation**
- Utilization ≤ 95%
- DTI ≤ 95%  
- Payment scores 300-850
- Non-negative accounts/history/inquiries
- Inquiry cap at 10

✅ **Missing Value Strategy**
- Thin-file customer handling (no credit history)
- Lower payment scores for new credit customers
- Zero utilization and accounts for thin files
- Realistic inquiry patterns for credit shoppers

### 2. `test_credit_history.py` (550 lines)
Comprehensive test suite containing:

#### Test Classes
- **`TestCreditHistoryGenerator`**: Core functionality tests
- **`TestDataQuality`**: Data integrity and consistency tests

#### Test Coverage
✅ **Range Validation Tests**
- Payment history scores (300-850)
- Credit utilization (0-95%)
- DTI ratios (0-95%)
- Account counts (0-20)
- Credit inquiries (0-10)

✅ **Correlation Tests**
- Income ↔ Payment score (positive)
- Age ↔ Credit history length (positive)
- Income ↔ Utilization (negative)
- Payment score ↔ Utilization (negative)
- Default probability ↔ Risk factors (strong correlations)

✅ **Business Rule Compliance Tests**
- All range limits enforced
- Logical consistency (0 accounts → 0 utilization)
- Thin-file customer handling

✅ **Statistical Distribution Tests**
- Payment scores approximately normal
- Utilization right-skewed (beta distribution)
- Accounts follow Poisson-like pattern

✅ **Risk Segmentation Tests**
- Low/medium/high risk segments properly defined
- Risk scores ordered correctly across segments
- Sufficient representation in each segment

✅ **Edge Case Tests**
- Very young customers (18-19 years old)
- Very old customers (70-75 years old)
- Reproducibility with random seeds
- Custom risk configuration

### 3. Supporting Files
- **`validate_requirements.py`**: Requirements validation script
- **`basic_validation.py`**: Structure and implementation verification
- **`IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md`**: This documentation

## Technical Specifications Met

### ✅ Credit History Variables Implemented
- **Payment history score**: 300-850 scale with realistic distribution
- **Credit utilization ratio**: 0-1 scale, correlated with income/debt
- **Credit history length**: Age-based with gamma distribution
- **Number of credit accounts**: 0-20+ with income correlation  
- **Recent credit inquiries**: 0-10 in last 2 years
- **Debt-to-income ratio**: 0-1 with demographic correlations
- **Composite risk scoring**: Weighted multi-factor risk assessment

### ✅ Business Logic Implemented
- Lower credit utilization → lower default risk
- Higher debt-to-income → higher default risk  
- Longer credit history → lower default risk
- Realistic correlations between all variables
- Industry-standard constraints and limits

### ✅ Default Probability Modeling
- Composite risk scoring influences all variables
- Payment history strongly impacts default probability
- DTI ratio increases default risk above 40%
- Risk multipliers based on multiple factors
- Realistic base rate with appropriate adjustments

### ✅ Validation and Quality Assurance
- Comprehensive range checking
- Business rule enforcement
- Missing value strategies
- Statistical distribution validation
- Correlation significance testing
- Risk segmentation capability

## Success Criteria Verification

### ✅ Realistic Correlations
- Income positively correlates with payment scores
- Age correlates with credit history length
- Utilization negatively correlates with income and payment scores
- Default probability significantly correlates with all risk factors

### ✅ Business-Acceptable Ranges
- Credit utilization: 0-95% (industry standard)
- DTI ratios: Majority under 43% (lending standard)
- Payment scores: Proper 300-850 FICO-like distribution
- Account counts: Realistic 0-20 range

### ✅ Industry Standards Compliance
- DTI ratios align with lending practices
- Payment score distributions match industry patterns

- Meaningful score distributions across segments
- Sufficient sample sizes for modeling
- Business-actionable risk insights

## Dependencies Handled
While Tasks 44 (Random Data Generation) and 45 (Customer Demographics Generator) were referenced as dependencies, the implementation includes:

- **Built-in random data generation**: All statistical distributions implemented using numpy
- **Flexible input handling**: Can work with any demographics DataFrame with required columns

## Integration Ready
The Credit History Generator is designed to integrate seamlessly with:
- Existing SAS-based credit risk pipeline
- Python-based machine learning workflows  
- Data warehousing and ETL processes
- Real-time scoring systems
- Model training and validation pipelines

## Performance Characteristics
- Handles 1000+ customers efficiently
- Vectorized operations for scalability
- Configurable parameters for different markets

## Usage Example
```python
from credit_history_generator import CreditHistoryGenerator, create_sample_demographics

# Create sample demographics
demographics = create_sample_demographics(1000, random_state=42)

# Initialize generator
generator = CreditHistoryGenerator(random_state=42)

# Generate complete credit profiles
credit_profiles = generator.generate_complete_credit_profile(demographics)

# View results
print(credit_profiles[['payment_history_score', 'credit_utilization', 
                      'debt_to_income_ratio', 'default_probability']].describe())
```
